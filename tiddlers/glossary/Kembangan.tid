"Flower Dance." A free flowing drill using stances, kicks, strikes, evasion / decoying techniques, Langkahs, Jurus, etc that is improvised on the spur of the moment. To shadow box.

The movement of the dance is a non-threatening means of practice, a way of meeting girls and a form of challenge to observers to see the "flower" (techniques), as opposed to demonstrating //buah//, "fruit" (applications) of a practitioner. The difficult and athletic "palm waving" movements train footwork, breathing, attack positions, skeletal interception, body torquing, positional changes to various directions, etc. It can be performed with a scarf, a candle, a saucer of water with a floating flower, etc. The music is provided by the [[Gamelan]] orchestra that also accompanies the fighting contests. Very often performed at weddings accompanied by music.

It is also practiced as a headhunters dance, with the heads carried in baskets hung from the shoulders. Also refers to a Royal blading art practice, one of the oldest, most effective and most traditional arts.  As a dance it is related to the [[Tari Piring]], the "plate dance", [[Tari Lilin]], the "candle dance", and the [[Randai]], the "folk theatre dance of the [[Minangkabau]] people". Linguistically related to //kembaggan//, "to return, to come back", Sundanese //kmbang//, "threshold" and //kmbangan//, "balance," and the root [[Bunga]], "flower."
